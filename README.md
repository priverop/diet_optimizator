# Diet Optimizator 3000

Linear Optimization tool to optimize a healthy diet. The foods are stored in the food.csv.

# How it works

- Fill up the food.csv with your favorite foods and its macros.
- Set your own macros or use the default ones.
- Choose your goals: Don't care, Low calories, High calories, Low protein, High protein, Low fat, High fat, Low carbs, High carbs, and Astrology-based.
- Get your optimal diet.

# Install

Make sure you have python 3 and pip 3 installed, then run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

After installation you can try running `python script.py` or `python3 script.py` depending on your installation.

# Possible Improvements

- Food type: one of the common issues is that you can get different foods of the same type. For example getting 200gr of lentils and 200gr of chickpeas. So, it would be nice to have a new column for "food type" and then limit every type to 1. Moreover, we could also tell the script to have a minimum of 5 portions of fruit, vegetables...
